# Python in PHP

## Overview

This code is released under the terms of the [MIT License][license].
Currently works under php5 and python2 only.
This fork will "eventually" upgrade to php7+python3

### Requirements

The Python extension has the following system requirements:

- PHP version 5.2.0 or later
- PEAR installer version 1.4.3 or later
- PHP dev headers (php7.3-dev)


### Installation

The easiest way to install the extension is by using the PECL installer::

    pecl install python

If you're building from source code, should use the ``--with-python``
configuration option.  If your copy of the Python hasn't been installed in one
of the default locations, you can specify it as a parameter::

    --with-python=/opt/python

More detailed information on installing PECL packages in general can be found
in the [Installation of PECL Extensions][pecl-install] section of the [PHP
Manual][php-manual].

### Source Code

This package's source code is hosted on GitHub:

    https://github.com/np43/php-python.git

    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends php7.3-dev python-dev re2c
    phpize
    ./configure --with-python


A number of unit tests are included to help maintain correct and expected
behavior.  The tests can be run using PECL tool's `run-tests` command:

    pecl run-tests -p python

Additional unit test contributions are welcome, especially when they increase
code coverage or exercise specific use cases.

## Usage

### INI Settings

#### python.optimize

The `python.optimize` INI setting controls the Python interpreter's runtime
optimization level.  This is a global, system-wide setting and therefore can
only be set in the PHP.ini file.

When set to **0** (the default), no additional optimizations are enabled, and
the built-in `__debug__` flag is True.

When set to **1** (equivalent to Python's `-O` command line option), the
Python interpreter will generate optimized bytecode, and the built-in
`__debug__` flag is set to False.

When set to **2** (equivalent to Python's `-OO` command line option), the
Python doc-strings will be removed in addition to the above optimizations.

## Development and Support
